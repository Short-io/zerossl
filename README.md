## Development

This project is in development as of January 2022. The project
is not ready for use yet but should be ready before the end of
the month. Your patience is appreciated.

## Usage

This library provides a wrapper for the ZeroSSL REST API.

```typescript
// TODO
```

## Tests

While I have endeavoured to write tests for this library, I have not
been able to comprehensively implement them. Most functionality has
been tested but as the documentation provided by ZeroSSL is quite
sparse, there may be edge cases that have not been accounted for.

Community contributions are welcome.

## Disclaimer

This library is a community open source project. There is no connection
with ZeroSSL or Stack Holdings GmbH. The term ZeroSSL/zerossl is recognised
as ZeroSSLâ„¢, a trademark of Stack Holdings GmbH in the USA, EU & UK and
this library is provided in good faith as a community open source project.
